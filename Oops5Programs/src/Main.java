////1.Class Inheritance and Polymorphism: You are building a system for a zoo. 
//Create a base class Animal with properties like name and age, and a method makeSound().
//Derive classes like Lion, Elephant, and Giraffe from Animal, each with their specific 
//sound implementation. Implement a Zoo class to manage a collection of animals. 
//Demonstrate polymorphism by iterating through the collection and calling the makeSound()
//method for each animal.
//
////2. Encapsulation and Access Control: You are designing a banking application. 
//Create a class BankAccount with private properties like accountNumber, balance, and 
//ownerName. Provide public methods for depositing, withdrawing, and getting the balance.
//Implement encapsulation by restricting direct access to the properties and using public
//methods to interact with them.
//
////3. final and constructor: Design an application where we need to have more than one
//constructor in a class. The final value of productkey should activate the antivirus
//for all clients who purchased the antivirus and those who not purchased they should 
//get the message saying "You are using free version, please upgrade"
////Remember: Transaction class should be there to process the transaction. Once the
//transaction done, then and then productkey should be approved. Else msg should be 
//displayed saying-"Transaction is not done - please pay first to activate product key"
//
////4. Method Overriding and Overloading: Build a reservation systems for hotel. 
//Create a class Room with properties like roomNumber, capacity, an pricePerNight. 
//Implement methods to check availability and make a reservation. Override the toString()
//method to provide a customized strin representation of a room. Implement method 
//overloading for reservation methods to handle different scenarios, like reserving with 
//or without specific check-in/check-out dates.
//
////5. Static and Instance Members: Build a student management system Create a class 
//Student with instance variables like studentID, name, and static variable totalStudents
//to keep track of the number of students Implement methods to enroll and drop students, 
//updating the totalStudents count accordingly.
//
////6. Write a code for tic-tac-toe game

import java.util.ArrayList;
